# Mastering Tailwind CSS v4

Tailwind CSS v4 brings a brand new engine written in Rust, offering incredible performance improvements and a simplified configuration experience.

## What's New?

### 1. The Oxide Engine
The new engine is significantly faster, making build times almost instant.

### 2. Zero Configuration
No more `tailwind.config.js` by default. You can configure everything directly in your CSS.

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  --color-primary: #3b82f6;
  --font-sans: "Inter", sans-serif;
}
```

### 3. CSS-first Configuration
Variables are now first-class citizens.

## Migrating from v3

Migration is straightforward for most projects. The main change is how you configure your theme and plugins.

## Best Practices

- Use semantic class names where possible
- Leverage the `@apply` directive sparingly
- embrace arbitrary values for one-off styles

Happy styling!
